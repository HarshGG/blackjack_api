Game of Blackjack created in Python, using the help of deckofcards api
#Some Rules that may be specific to this version of the game
1. The value of the first ace in a player/dealer's hand is always 11, every other ace counts as 1
2. If the player gets a blackjack, then he/she wins only if the dealer doesn't have a blackjack. If both have a blackjack, then it's a push.
